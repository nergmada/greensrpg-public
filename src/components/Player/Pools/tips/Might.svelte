    <p>Might is the pool used when attempting any kind of strength based action, including most attack actions</p>
    <p>Pools can be replenished by resting. When resting you roll a d6 and can decide which pools to apply those points to. For example, if you roll 5 on a d6, you can put 3 points into might, 1 into intellect, and 1 into speed</p>
    <p>e.g. Attack with physical weapons, breaking down doors, climbing</p>
