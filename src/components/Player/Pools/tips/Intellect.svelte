    <p>Intellect is the pool used when attempting any kind of perception, charm or interaction based action. It is used in metaphysical combat</p>
    <p>Pools can be replenished by resting. When resting you roll a d6 and can decide which pools to apply those points to. For example, if you roll 5 on a d6, you can put 3 points into might, 1 into intellect, and 1 into speed</p>
    <p>e.g. Telekinetic attacks and defense, studying items, deciphering languages, charming people</p>
