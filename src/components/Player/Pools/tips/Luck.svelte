    <p>Luck is an additional pool that certain configuration of characters can draw on. It is like a wildcard pool that can be used in lieu of other points</p>
    <p>Pools can be replenished by resting. When resting you roll a d6 and can decide which pools to apply those points to. For example, if you roll 5 on a d6, you can put 3 points into might, 1 into intellect, and 1 into speed</p>
    <p>Luck is restored at the same time as other pools, with the same quantity of points as other pools are restored</p>
