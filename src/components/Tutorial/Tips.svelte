<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Make your actions descriptive and detailed, as this can benefit you. For example "I duck behind a tree and fire my pistol", may provide you with a defense advantage in the next round of combat</li>
    <li>Use actions to extract information from the GM, say for example "I look for a hidden passage" or "I try to translate these inscriptions". Some players will be better suited to this task than others</li>
    <li>Play to your characters strengths. Some players are better for combat, some are better when trying to problem solve. For example in combat, have your strongest players up front to absorb damage and shield your weaker team members.</li>
