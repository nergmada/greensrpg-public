<h2>Determining Combat Order</h2>
<p>Some characters are faster to react and some are slower to react. As such we have to work out what order combat takes place in, and in particular who gets the drop on an NPC and who doesn't</p>
<p>Generally the level of a given NPC dictates the difficulty of whether you go first. E.g. A level 3 Knight has a difficulty of 9 (3 * 3). If you roll 9 or above you go first, if you roll below the Knight goes first.</p>
