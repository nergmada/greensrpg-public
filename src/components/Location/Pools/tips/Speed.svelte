    <p>Speed is the pool used when attempting any kind of athletic based action, including most defense actions</p>
    <p>Pools can be replenished by resting. When resting you roll a d6 and can decide which pools to apply those points to. For example, if you roll 5 on a d6, you can put 3 points into might, 1 into intellect, and 1 into speed</p>
    <p>e.g. dodging the swing of a blade, jumping over a large gap, swimming</p>
