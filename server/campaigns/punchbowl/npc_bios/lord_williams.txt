The enigmatic Lord Williams of Chelsea has had a keen interest in the occult as a child. A wealthy Scottish aristocrat with strong connections to various smugglers and underworld ner-do-wells, he's built something of a criminal empire smuggling occult artifacts from British colonial interests across the world, back to London, under the pseudonym Crimson Charlie.

As a Lord he's shown little interesting in marrying and preserving his line, instead leaving homeliness to his straight-laced military brother. An explorer, whose hard drinking has earned him a reputation as something of a party animal, his interest in the occult remain unclear, although he occasionally alludes to a Haitian wet nurse he had as a child who would tell him stories of supernatural phenomena.
