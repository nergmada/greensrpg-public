The Blue Mask is tall and broad, though they look fat as opposed to muscular. They're wearing a long dark blue robe, layered with tones of black and blue fabrics, their face covered by a mask of pure untextured porcelain dark blue, sat back in a hood. Even their company gives them wide space, offering only a secondary presence to their looming figure.
