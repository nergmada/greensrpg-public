Agent Alice Thirlby is a a short ginger haired woman, standing at a mere five foot and three inches. Her curly bob cut hair is covered by a bowler hat, and a carefully tailored suit, tie and jacket, and a long walking umbrella on her left arm.

The silver chain of a pocket watch droops just out of her suit, as her piercing blue eyes stare down every piece of eye contact, and her smile seems more like a trick she's learnt rather than a sincere positive smile.
