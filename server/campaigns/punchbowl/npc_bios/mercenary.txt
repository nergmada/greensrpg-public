This mercenary looks like former, or maybe even current, British infantry. Whilst he's not in a military uniform, wearing more casual attire, certain elements such as his boots and his belt indicate that his equipment is military issue. He appears to be wearing some degree of armour, though it most like doesn't offer much protection it probably helps a little.
