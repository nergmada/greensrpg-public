Elphie Green is a short woman in her mid 50s, with greying hair, her dark brown eyes tired from a long day. She sits by a carava, with some jewellery in her hands, some kind of silver and gold chain with various gems and jewels embedded in it. Her dress is ornate, and bares a more detailed patterning than some of the other attire, but only noticeably so when you give her more than a second look.
