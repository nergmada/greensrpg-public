The cages have a wood stake driven into the ground in the middle of them to which each of you have been tied individually within your own cage. Two scouts sit around a fire adjacent to the cages, not watching you as the warm themselves. Each cage appears to have been constructed from wood reclaimed from the surrounding forest.
