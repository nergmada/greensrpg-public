Level 4 stealth task (highest for all): You guide you and your team nibbly through the approach to the camp, entering without alerting any of the scouting parties that surround the camp. These individuals seem prepared for a fight, more so than most Traveller Camps, as you get suspicious and agitated stares, a woman steps out of one of the caravans.

Level 2 charm task (highest for all): As you approach, one of the members of the camp stops you, blocking your path into camp. He asks what business such a large group has coming to the camp in the middle of the night. He then proceeds to explain that this land is common land and that they have a right to be there. You interject explaining your situation and convince him of your good intentions.
