Level 2 perception task: You notice a distinctly different type of crate on the second floor that appears new, perhaps as recent as today, and immediately make your way to it searching it you find it stuffed with hay with padding. Underneath the first layer of hay, you find a carved stone tablet.

The tablet shows the image of an ancient ruler, a Queen maybe, and a woman, a princess perhaps. The regal carving has an ancient language inscribed around it

You also find a quiver of arrows, ancient and unlike any modern arrow, they have a stone balance on them to give them a heavy feel

Level 5 knowledge task: The inscription loosely translates to "Should this sacred stone be removed, then let the seal and bond of love and loss be broken". Further inscriptions are impossible to translate as the stone appears to belong to larger stone.
