Stealth Level 5: You approach and investigate the camp from a small blind spot in their perimeter. From a safe distance you see a woman you instantly recognise, Lady Arhur, hands bound in rope, sat by the fire in the company of a robed mercenary, that unlike the other mercenaries does not appear to be in the possession of a weapon.

Attack: Each party should now start containing one acolyte, and two mercenaries.
