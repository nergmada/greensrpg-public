The blue mask is alone besides Lady arthur who sits on the ground as the mask chants an incantation. There's a rear complement of 2 acolytes and 2 mercenaries who have come down having recognised the entrance of your party.

As Lady Arthur sees you, she stands up and full throttle kicks the blue mask catching him off guard as she runs to join your party, despite her hands being bound. 

Split party into two combat groups, for the final battle. 

The cave starts to collapse after the blue mask's defeat, as he falls to the ground his mask falls off revealing him to be Lord Williams.
