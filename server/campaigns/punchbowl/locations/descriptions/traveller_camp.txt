The camp is an large encirclement of caravans, primarily a mixture of wood and iron wagons. There are two fires at the centre of the oval encampment, both with pots over them bubbling something that is presumably edible. 

A couple of older children and a couple of mothers are coddling children as they sit either at the steps to a caravan or closer to the warm orange glow of the fire. A couple of laterns have been set upon makeshift frames to give illumination to the other edges of the camp and scare off any wildlife that might be tempted to forage goods from the camp.

The men are predominantly sitting and chatting separately and one plays music on the accordion.
