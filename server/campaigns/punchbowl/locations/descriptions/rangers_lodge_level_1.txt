The inside of the lodge is reminiscent of a lighthouse, a single floor with a small wood bed a table covered with various papers, and some various equipment necessary for the maintenance of the surrounding forests. A few faintly lit laterns scatter the room.

The second floor is a ledge that protrudes from the exterior walls, leaving a clear view of the roof from the ground floor. There is no staircase and it appears that the ladder that would allow access to the second floor has been removed. The second floor has several windows providing natural moonlight.
