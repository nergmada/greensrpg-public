The shrine is decorated in reds and golds, with a plethora of other colours adorning its furnishings and artifacts, the hermit appears to have maintain most of the candles that surround the chamber, and made something of a makeshift bed from linens left in the shrine. A single door sits off from the main hall.

The hermit is wearing what appear the be ancient robes, and despite the hood covering most of his face, a beard protrudes down his torso. He sits quietly as you enter the tomb. Saying nothing.
