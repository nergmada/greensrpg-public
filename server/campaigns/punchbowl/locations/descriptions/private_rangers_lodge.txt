The rangers lodge is covered in occult symbology. This would be recognised by a occult specialist. Alternatively, an adept would also be able to detect the presence of certain curses on the runes. 

Interpreting the language and reading the story is a level 6 roll.

The images that trace around the fascia on the second floor of the lodge tell the story of an ancient battle waged between dark underworld spirits, and a royal dynasty located in some ancient unidentifiable mountain range.
